# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

# Overview

Here's a screenshot and the link to my [QR code] (images/screenshot-final-look-desktop.PNG)!

# My process

I lowkey thought this was going to be way harder, because the first thing that came up on my mind was 'What I gotta create a QR code??? How am I suppossed to do that? I'm a web developer, I dont do QRs' lol. But then after calming myself down, I realized it was actually way easier and I didn't have to code a QR.
Anyways, in order to complete the challenge, I looked at the design image, did a sketch on paper of what I was looking at and realized that there was probably:
-1 div containing:
-1 img (the QR)
-1 h2 element
-1 p element
And with that on mind, the fun begun! I just started coding away and that was pretty much it!!
